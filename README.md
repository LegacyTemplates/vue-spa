.NET 6.0 Vue Webpack App Template

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/csharp-templates/vue-spa.png)](http://vue-spa.web-templates.io/)

> Browse [source code](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-spa), view live demo [vue-spa.web-templates.io](http://vue-spa.web-templates.io) and install with [x new](https://docs.servicestack.net/dotnet-new):

    $ dotnet tool install -g x

    $ x new vue-spa ProjectName

Alternatively write new project files directly into an empty repository, using the Directory Name as the ProjectName:

    $ git clone https://github.com/<User>/<ProjectName>.git
    $ cd <ProjectName>
    $ x new vue-spa

## Development workflow

Our recommendation during development is to run the `dev` npm script or Gulp task and leave it running in the background:

    $ npm run dev

This initially generates a full development build of your Web App then stays running in the background to process files as they’re changed. This enables the normal dev workflow of running your ASP.NET Web App, saving changes locally which are then reloaded using ServiceStack’s built-in hot reloading. Alternatively hitting `F5` will refresh the page and view the latest changes.

Each change updates the output dev resources so even if you stop the dev task your Web App remains in a working state that’s viewable when running the ASP.NET Web App.

### Live reload with built-in Dev Server

The alternative dev workflow is to run the `serve` npm or gulp script to run Create React App's built-in Webpack dev server:

    $ npm run serve

This launches the Webpack dev server listening at `http://localhost:8080/` and configured to proxy all non-Webpack HTTP requests to the ASP.NET Web App where it handles all Server API requests. The benefit of viewing your App through the Webpack dev server is its built-in Live Reload feature where it will automatically reload the page as resources are updated. We’ve found the Webpack dev server ideal when developing UI’s where your Web App is running side-by-side VS.NET, where every change saved triggers the dev server to reload the current page so changes are visible immediately.

The disadvantage of the dev server is that all transformations are kept in memory so when the dev server is stopped, the Web Apps resources are lost, so it requires a webpack-build in order to generate a current build. There’s also a lag in API requests resulting from all server request being proxied.

### Watched .NET Core builds

.NET Core projects can also benefit from Live Coding using dotnet watch which performs a “watched build” where it automatically stops, recompiles and restarts your .NET Core App when it detects source file changes. You can start a watched build from the command-line with:

    $ dotnet watch run

### Create a production build

Run the `build` npm script or gulp task to generate a static production build of your App saved to your .NET App's `/wwwroot` folder:

    $ npm run build

This will let you run the production build of your App that's hosted by your .NET App.

### Updating Server TypeScript DTOs

Run the `dtos` npm script or Gulp task to update your server dtos in `/src/dtos.ts`:

    $ npm run dtos

### Deployments

When your App is ready to deploy, run the `publish` npm (or Gulp) script to package your App for deployment:

    $ npm run publish

Which will create a production build of your App which then runs `dotnet publish -c Release` to Publish a Release build of your App in the `/bin/net5/publish` folder which can then copied to remote server or an included in a Docker container to deploy your App.

### Testing

Run the `test` npm script or gulp task to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

    $ npm test

To launch a live testing session that continuously reruns tests when making source code changes, run the `test-watch` npm script instead:

    $ npm run test-watch

To run end-to-end integration tests with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/):

    $ npm run e2e

## Vue CLI App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vue CLI App](https://cli.vuejs.org) which contains the official documentation to learn more about developing with Vue CLI Apps.
